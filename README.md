# ZEN

ZEN is a BERT-based Chinese **(Z)** text encoder **E**nhanced by **N**-gram representations, where different combinations of characters are considered during training. The potential word or phrase boundaries are explicitly pre-trained and fine-tuned with the character encoder (BERT), so that ZEN incorporates the comprehensive information of both the character sequence and words or phrases it contains. The structure of ZEN is illustrated in the figure below.

## Quick tour of pre-training and fine-tune using ZEN

The library comprises several example scripts for conducting [**Chinese NLP tasks**](/datasets):

- `run_pre_train.py`: an example pre-training ZEN
- `run_sequence_level_classification.py`: an example fine-tuning ZEN on DC, SA, SPM and NLI tasks (*sequence-level classification*)

'''python

python examples/run_sequence_level_classification.py --data_dir ./datasets/ChnSentiCorp --bert_model bert-base-chinese --task_name chnsenticorp




- `run_token_level_classification.py`: an example fine-tuning ZEN on CWS, POS and NER tasks (*token-level classification*)
