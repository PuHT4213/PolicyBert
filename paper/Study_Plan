Study Plan

1) Research Area of Interest and Major. 

Major: Master of Professional Studies (MPS) in Information Science
University: Cornell University
Time: 2025.8 - 2026.5
Location: Ithaca, New York, USA 

Description of Research Area of Interest and Major:

I am pursuing the Master of Professional Studies (MPS) in Information Science at Cornell University, focusing on User Experience Design and Data Science track. This program offers a comprehensive curriculum that combines technical proficiency with an understanding of the social and behavioral aspects of information technology.

In the program I aim to develop skills in analyzing large datasets using data mining techniques and strong programming abilities. I plan to enroll in courses that cover both the technical aspects of information systems and the human and social systems to gain a holistic understanding of data science applications.

Why I chose this program:

During my sophomore year, I carefully evaluated my academic and career goals in light of my major, Information Management (IM). I realized that while IM provides a solid foundation in natural language processing (NLP) and related fields, it lacks the technical depth and industry focus required to gain a competitive edge in the job market. Additionally, I recognized that my major's reputation and my GPA might not position me strongly for admission to computer science programs at top engineering schools in China.

Given these considerations, I decided to pursue a one-year master's program in the United States, such as the Master of Professional Studies (MPS) in Information Science at Cornell University. This program offers a unique opportunity to quickly acquire advanced technical skills and a globally recognized degree. I aim to build expertise in areas like data mining, machine learning, and programming, which are highly sought after in China's rapidly evolving technology landscape. This strategic decision allows me to efficiently enhance my qualifications and establish a competitive advantage in the domestic job market upon my return.

Future Plans:

I plan to leverage the skills and knowledge gained from the MPS in Information Science program to contribute to the growing field of data science in China. After graduation, I intend to return to China and seek opportunities in industries such as technology, finance, or healthcare, where data-driven decision-making is becoming increasingly critical. I'm currently interning at "Mianbi Intelligence," a leading chinese company in the field of artificial intelligence and data analytics. Upon returning to China, I may explore the possibility of transitioning to a full-time role at Mianbi Intelligence, where I can continue contributing to innovative data-driven solutions and support the company's mission to drive technological advancements in the industry.


2) Advisor or Potential Advisor 

This program is an course-based program, so there is no specified research advisor. But here are some professors I am interested in working with:

Claire Cardie
Professor; Computer Science, Information Science, Joseph C. Ford Professor of Engineering; Information Science Field Faculty
Areas of Interest: Natural language processing

I'm interested in her work on natural language processing, which align with my interests and research experience in my undergraduate studies. 

Jeff Rzeszotarski
Assistant Professor; Information Science, Information Science Field Faculty
Areas of Interest: Data visualization, crowdsourcing, and social computing

I'm interested in his work on data visualization, in which researchers combine data analysis and user experience design to create effective visualizations. This aligns with my interests in data visualization and user experience design, and I believe his expertise would greatly enhance my understanding of these areas.
